# AddFileExtension
## Purpose
Allows you to add files to your working folder by typing in a path relative to the working folder.
Missing subfolders are created automatically.
## Usage

Using the command palette:

* Bring up the command palette, and select "Folder: Add file".
* In the input box, type the path to your file, relative to your working folder.
* Press [Enter] to confirm, or [Escape] to cancel.

Keyboard shortcut:

* Add a user keyboard shortcut for command "addfileextension.addFile"

Your file will be opened in a new editor window, and shown in working files.

You may now save the file, which will add it to your working folder (along with any directory that needs to be created), or dismiss the editor and discard the unsaved file in working files if you changed your mind.
